## We have 4 brush types which are all you need to draw fast:
## 我们提供4种笔刷类型，您需要快速绘制它们：

* **Light pencil** for roughing
* **Pencil** for fast sketching
* **Pen** for inking strong lines
* **Brush** for filling in some shading

You can also specificy 3 brush sizes for each type.

Each brush has its own 5 color pallete. You can set all the colors as you like.

There are no layers. Again, you're boarding story ideas. Managing layers creates so much unneeded complexity and UI mess. A board artist that uses layers probably voted for Trump - or paid way too much for "Pro" storyboard software.

Made a mistake? You can erase that shit.

You can undo and redo.

Made a big mistake? You can clear the whole thing.

If it's off center or too big or too small, you can shift your drawing around or scale it.

Need a straight line? Hold shift while you're drawing and you got straight lines.

## There are 5 guide overlays to toggle:

*  Grid
*  Center Marks
*  Thirds
*  Angles
*  Onion skin (previous and next board in shot)

## FAQ

**"CHARLES, I RESPEKT UR OPINIONATED SOFTWARE DESIGN GANGSTER, BUT I NEED TO POLISH MY DRAWINGS TIGHTER."**
No problem, needy bruh. You can click a button to edit in photoshop, and when you save, it updates in Storyboarder.

**"CHARLES, STORYBOARDER IS REVOLUTIONARY. PERHAPS BIGGER THAN JESUS AND WRESTLING. - Saul Bass"**
Fuck you, Saul Bass. Absolutely bigger than Jesus and wrestling. Also, your work output has really dropped off in recent years.

**"HOW COME WHEN I'M DRAWING, I HEAR THE IMPERIAL MARCH?"**
You're probably boarding on the Simpsons. You might want to escape North Korea through China. If not shot crossing the river, you will probably be sold into slavery by the Chinese. Work for 5 years, buy your freedom and make your way to Seoul. This should fix your issue. You're welcome.
